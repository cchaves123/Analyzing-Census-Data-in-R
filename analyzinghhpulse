#this code draws from weeks 28-33 of the Household Pulse Survey, or Phase 3.1
#if using data from a different phase, small edits will likely need to be made
#for example, the order of the variables for reasons for not working will probably be different

#because this code draws from six installations of survey data, the final results and their errors must be divided by 6
#this will give the same result as a 6-week average
#note that dividing the errors by 6 does not seem to give the exact answer, but it is very close
